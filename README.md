# Remote Sensing-Based Assessment of Economic Development

The goal of our project is to use satellite data (including nighttime light data and remote sensing
images) to give us some statistical estimation of the economic development level of a selected area
(Singapore). Findings from the project could inform policymakers about areas needing intervention or
support for economic development initiatives. Insights gained might aid in targeted policy formulation
for infrastructure, agriculture, urban planning, or resource management.

## Economic Activity Estimation Based on Light Intensity

In this section, we focus on estimating economic activity based on light intensity from nighttime
light (NLT) data. However, the raw nighttime light data suffers from the problems of interannual
inconsistency, saturation, and blooming. Researchers have proposed several methods to address these
issues. Unfortunately, their methods only overcome one or more of these problems and a global data
product for all the solvable issues has yet to emerge. Therefore, we aim to produce a consistent and
corrected NLT dataset before we predict GDP based on the light intensity from NLT data.

## Economic Activity Estimation Based on Boat Intensity

The second part of this project uses computer vision technology to automatically count the number
of ships in Singapore ports, and compares and analyzes these data with official port throughput and
GDP data. This section emphasizes the important position of Singaporeâ€™s ports in international trade
and the importance of accurate logistics data for economic analysis. This helps governments and
businesses better understand and predict economic trends. For this part, we consider the Port of
Singapore.
